If you want to know what all data we store, you can use the show mydata command
To check available slots by Pincode you can use check pincode PINCODE_OF_YOUR_PLACE DATE_YOU_ARE_LOOKING_IN_DD-MM-YYYY_FORMAT command. For example -> If your Pincode is 676504 and you need to know the available slot on 25th May 2021, check pincode 676504 25-05-2021
You can also update your age using update age YOUR_UPDATED_AGEcommand.
